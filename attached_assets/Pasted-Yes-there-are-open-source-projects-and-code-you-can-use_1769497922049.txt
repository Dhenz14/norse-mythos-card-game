Yes — there **are open-source projects and code you can use** as a starting point for tracking large card inventories, counting how many of each card you have (like 1 × Rare, 100 × commons, etc.) and even *generating randomized packs* with rarity logic. You’d likely adapt these to your own game or NFT system since many are collection tools rather than full game engines.

## 🧠 Open-Source Tools & Code You Can Examine

### 📌 1. **TCG Pocket Collection Tracker**

* **GitHub**: *tcg-pocket-collection-tracker* – a real project for tracking cards across a collection.
* Tracks card counts, expansions, rarities, and includes pack-related logic like “optimal pack to open.”
* Tech: React/TypeScript frontend + Supabase backend.
* **Good for:** inventory tracking logic, database schema ideas, filters, and collection UIs. ([GitHub][1])

👉 You can fork this and add **pack generation** and **rarity counts** as additional modules.

---

### 📌 2. **Cardex (multi-TCG card manager)**

* Not focused on pack randomness, but a modern TCG tracking platform that shows how multiple games can be supported with card metadata and rarity info.
* Helpful for database schema ideas. ([GitHub][2])

---

### 📌 3. **Card-Collection-Manager-2**

* A desktop-style TCG inventory manager supporting multiple games.
* Focus is tracking collections, images, and associations — good to learn how to architect a large-scale tracker. ([GitHub][3])

---

### 📌 4. **Pack Opener / Pack Generator Code Examples**

These are *not full games* but illustrate how to handle random pack generation with rarity weighting:

#### 🃏 a) **Pokemon Pack Opener UI**

* A JavaScript project that simulates opening randomized Pokémon packs with rarity distribution rules (no duplicates per pack, rarity weighting logic).
* You can lift the **pack randomness logic** from this for your own tools. ([GitHub][4])

#### 🧪 b) **SorceryPackGen (Go)**

* A **pack generator tool** for a fantasy card game, with CLI commands to produce random card packs from a configured database.
* A great basis if you want a **backend service** that outputs packs based on rarity tables. ([Go Packages][5])

## 📦 NFT / Blockchain Pack Systems (Example)

If you want each card to be an NFT (e.g., ERC-1155/721), the **pack logic often lives in smart contracts** and JavaScript tooling:

* Thirdweb guide — how to deploy **pack contracts** for NFTs and generate random contents with scripts.
* Useful for games where packs generate NFT cards on chain. ([thirdweb][6])

## 🧩 How to Build Yourself (Guideline / Code Outline)

Below is a **simple node.js example** illustrating pack generation + inventory tracking based on rarities.

### Example: Card Pool & Pack Generation (Node.js)

```js
// Example deck data
const cards = [
  { id: 'C001', name: 'Common A', rarity: 'common' },
  { id: 'C002', name: 'Common B', rarity: 'common' },
  { id: 'U001', name: 'Uncommon A', rarity: 'uncommon' },
  { id: 'R001', name: 'Rare A', rarity: 'rare' },
  // … add more
];

// Rarity weights for pack logic
const rarityWeights = {
  common: 70,
  uncommon: 20,
  rare: 9,
  ultra: 1
};

function getRandomCardByRarity() {
  const total = Object.values(rarityWeights).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let rand = Math.random() * total;
  for (let rarity in rarityWeights) {
    rand -= rarityWeights[rarity];
    if (rand <= 0) {
      const pool = cards.filter(c => c.rarity === rarity);
      return pool[Math.floor(Math.random() * pool.length)];
    }
  }
}

// Generate pack with e.g., 10 cards
function generatePack(size = 10) {
  const pack = [];
  while (pack.length < size) {
    const card = getRandomCardByRarity();
    if (!pack.find(p => p.id === card.id)) { // no duplicates
      pack.push(card);
    }
  }
  return pack;
}

// Track inventory
let inventory = {};
function addToInventory(card) {
  inventory[card.id] = (inventory[card.id] || 0) + 1;
}

// Example usage:
const pack = generatePack(10);
pack.forEach(c => addToInventory(c));
console.log('Pack:', pack);
console.log('Inventory counts:', inventory);
```

## 🗂 Database Schema Ideas

You’ll need tables/collections like:

| Table            | Fields                                         | Purpose                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `cards`          | id, name, rarity, set_code, metadata…          | Master card list           |
| `card_counts`    | card_id, count                                 | Inventory counts           |
| `packs`          | id, creation_date, contents (list of card_ids) | Pack history               |
| `rarity_weights` | rarity, weight                                 | Controls pack distribution |

## 🧠 Tips / Best Practices

✅ **Use existing TCG datasets**
Packages like *pokemon-tcg-pocket-database* (JSON of cards & rarities) can speed up development. ([Libraries.io][7])

✅ **Separate pack logic from inventory logic**
One module generates packs → another updates collection counts.

✅ **NFT versions**
If on blockchain, design smart contracts to store metadata and **randomness (e.g., VRF)** so each pack opening is provably fair. ([thirdweb][6])

If you tell me **the platform/stack you want (web app? blockchain? Unity?), the scale (millions of cards?), and whether cards are NFTs or plain database entries**, I can tailor sample code and architecture specifically for your project.
