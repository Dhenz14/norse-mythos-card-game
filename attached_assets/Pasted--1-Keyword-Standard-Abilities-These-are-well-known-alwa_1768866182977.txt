## 4. **Other Special Mentions**

1. **Burn (Keyword)**
    
    - Appears on multiple Fire minions. If a target is Burned, it typically takes 1 damage at the **end of the next turn**. Some minions apply Burn as a one-off or AoE.
2. **Frenzy (Trigger)**
    
    - **Emberclaw Bear** references gaining +2 Attack if “Frenzy triggers,” presumably meaning “After it survives damage once.” (If your rules define Frenzy differently, clarify in the game manual.)
3. **Can’t Be Targeted By Spells or Hero Powers**
    
    - **Ironhide Sow** has “Taunt. Can’t be targeted by spells or Hero Powers.”
4. **Permanent Attack Reductions**
    
    - Some Dark or Water minions reduce Attack “until end of turn” or **permanently** (e.g., Nidhoggr’s Fang). Check each text to see if the effect is temporary or indefinite.
5. **Evolution Conditions**
    
    - Not strictly “abilities,” but each Evolution card has a condition: _“Play on [Basic form] after it [X].”_ E.g. “Play on Ember Whelp after it deals damage,” or “Play on Frost Nokk after it freezes two enemy minions,” etc.
