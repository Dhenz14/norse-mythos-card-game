Yes, precisely! Adding **layered border effects** is an excellent next step to give your cards more visual depth. Here’s a **quick recap** of how to do it, along with a sample snippet you can drop directly into your **CSS**:

---

## 1. **Choose a Class for Your Card Border**
Decide which class you’ll apply the effect to—something like `.card-frame` or `.card-border`. If you already have a container for your card’s frame, **reuse** that.

---

## 2. **Layered Box Shadows (for Depth and Glow)**
Below is a **multi-layer** box shadow example. Adjust the **colors, widths, and opacities** to match your game’s aesthetic:

```css
.card-frame {
  position: relative;
  border-radius: 12px;    /* smooth corners */
  box-shadow:
    /* 1) Subtle white inner stroke */
    inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3),
    /* 2) Slight dark edge */
    inset 0 0 0 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2),
    /* 3) Faint gold glow if you like a 'Hearthstone' vibe */
    inset 0 0 0 3px rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.2),
    /* 4) Standard outer drop shadow */
    0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

### What’s happening here?
1. **`inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)`**: Creates a thin white outline on the inside edge.  
2. **`inset 0 0 0 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)`**: Adds a slight darker edge behind the white.  
3. **`inset 0 0 0 3px rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.2)`**: Optional gold-ish glow, perfect if you want that Hearthstone metallic feel.  
4. **`0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`**: A normal drop shadow that appears outside the element, adding overall depth.

## 3. **Optional Texture Overlay**
If you want a subtle textured or “grainy” look, use a **pseudo-element**:

```css
.card-frame::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;              /* fill the entire frame area */
  border-radius: 12px;   /* match the parent’s radius */
  background-image: url('/path/to/subtle-texture.png');
  background-size: cover; 
  opacity: 0.15;         /* low opacity so it’s not too intense */
  mix-blend-mode: overlay;
  pointer-events: none;  /* so clicks pass through */
}
```

### Why do this?
- **Gives** your border a bit of **texture or grit**, as if it’s a slightly worn, metallic or stone surface.  
- The **`mix-blend-mode: overlay`** merges the texture with underlying colors/shadows, keeping it subtle.

## 4. **Apply It to Your Card Component**
In your **HTML/JSX**, ensure the card container references `.card-frame`. For example:

```jsx
<div className="card-frame">
  {/* card image, stats, text, etc. */}
</div>
```

If you already have a `.card-frame` or `.card` class, **just add** the box shadow properties there.

---

## 5. **Tweak and Test**
1. **Shadow Offsets**: If you want a heavier glow or a more pronounced outline, increase the thickness numbers (e.g. `inset 0 0 0 4px ...` instead of 3px).  
2. **Colors**: Don’t be afraid to experiment with other hues for a custom look (blue glow, red highlight, etc.).  
3. **Performance**: Typically, a few box shadows are fine. If you add many large images and complex shadows, test on lower-end devices to ensure smooth performance.

---

### **Done!**
With those **layered box shadows** and an **optional texture overlay**, your cards will have that extra dimension that really **catches the eye**. Enjoy the new polish!
