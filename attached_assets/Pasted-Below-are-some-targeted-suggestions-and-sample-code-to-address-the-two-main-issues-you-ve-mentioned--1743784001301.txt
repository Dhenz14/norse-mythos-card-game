Below are some targeted suggestions—and sample code—to address the two main issues you’ve mentioned:

1. **Force “Battlecry: ...” (and similar keywords) onto the same line as the subsequent text**  
2. **Achieve a crisp “carved into metal” appearance while ensuring text remains clearly visible**

## 1. Ensure “Battlecry:” Doesn’t Break Onto a New Line

**Why It Happens**  
- If your text insertion or parsing introduces extra breaks or if there’s a non-breaking character issue (like `\n` or `<br>` tags in the wrong place), you might end up with “Battlecry:” on one line and the rest on the next line.  
- Also, some styling or wrapper `<span>` elements could inadvertently force line breaks if they’re display: `block` or if there’s a stray whitespace node.

**Steps to Fix**  
1. **Check Your Format Function:** In your `formatCardText` (or wherever you’re injecting “Battlecry:”) ensure you do not have any unintentional line breaks in the source strings.  
2. **Use `display: inline`** or `display: inline-block` for the “Battlecry:” label and the subsequent text so they remain on the same line, unless the text truly can’t fit horizontally.  
3. **Remove Forced Breaks:** For instance, if you previously added `<br />` in the code after “Battlecry:”, remove it so it’s all one string or a single inline element.

### Example: Format Function Snippet

```js
export function formatCardText(description: string): React.ReactNode {
  // Hypothetical scenario: searching for keywords (Battlecry, Deathrattle, etc.)
  // and wrapping them in a <span> for styling

  let replacedText = description
    .replace(/\b(Battlecry):/g, "<span class='keyword-battlecry'>$1:</span>") 
    .replace(/\b(Deathrattle):/g, "<span class='keyword-deathrattle'>$1:</span>");

  // Now replacedText is HTML with <span> wrappers. We then parse to JSX:
  return <span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: replacedText }} />;
}
```

### Ensuring Inline Display in CSS

```css
.keyword-battlecry, .keyword-deathrattle {
  display: inline;    /* or inline-block */
  font-weight: 700;
  white-space: nowrap; /* Prevent wrap for the word plus colon */
  margin-right: 0.25rem; /* Slight spacing after the colon */
}
```

By using `white-space: nowrap;` on the keyword’s span, you ensure it stays on the same line as the next word unless the text hits the container’s boundary.

## 2. Perfecting the “Carved Into Metal” Look

**Why It May Be Invisible**  
- The text color or stroke might be too close to the background color.  
- The `text-shadow` or `-webkit-text-stroke` settings might be too subtle or overshadowed by your metallic card texture.

**Steps to Fix**  
1. **Verify Text Color vs. Background:** Make sure your text color and stroke contrast strongly with the card’s metallic gradient.  
2. **Use Multi-Layer Shadows:** Hearthstone’s “carved” effect typically uses two or more shadows: a lighter highlight above, and a darker shadow below.  
3. **Adjust Stroke Width & Opacity:** If the stroke is too thin or too transparent, the effect won’t be noticeable.

### Example: CSS for a Crisp Engraved Look

```css
.card-description {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;        /* or flex if you have more complex layout */
  font-size: 1rem;              /* adjust based on card scale */
  font-weight: 700;             /* heavier for clarity */
  color: #3b1f07;               /* dark brown or near-black */
  text-align: center;
  /* Carved text effect - highlight + shadow */
  text-shadow:
    0 1px 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.4),  /* top highlight */
    0 -1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.6);       /* deeper bottom shadow */

  /* Outline (stroke) adds extra clarity */
  -webkit-text-stroke: 0.75px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);

  /* If your background is dark, lighten these or invert them accordingly */
}

/* You can also add a subtle outer glow to the text for more contrast: */
.card-description.glow {
  text-shadow:
    0 0 2px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4),
    0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
  -webkit-text-stroke: 0.5px rgba(255,255,255,0.2);
}
```

**Tip:** If you’re struggling to see the text, temporarily crank up the shadows and stroke values. Once you confirm the effect is visible, then dial them back to a more subtle level.

## 3. Maintain a Neat Single Text Box

To keep the text from overlapping the gem or other card elements:

1. **Contain the text in a dedicated `.card-text-box`** with sufficient top/bottom padding so it doesn’t clash with the gem area.  
2. **Use `overflow: hidden;`** or `overflow: auto;` if needed, especially for longer text.  
3. **Center the text** using `justify-content: center; align-items: center; text-align: center;`

### Example: Centered Text Container

```css
.card-text-box {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 1.5rem;            /* enough space above gem */
  left: 0.5rem;
  right: 0.5rem;
  height: calc(50% - 2rem);  /* or any suitable fraction */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;   /* vertical center in the container */
  align-items: center;       /* horizontal center */
  overflow: hidden;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 1rem;
}

.card-description {
  /* The style from above for the carved look */
}
```

## 4. Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Check Real vs. Computed Styles:** Right-click in the browser DevTools and inspect the `.card-description` and its parent container. Look for any forced breaks, margins, or `display: block;`.
2. **Look Out for Extra Whitespace Characters:** Sometimes your JSON or string data might contain `\n` or `\r\n`. Trim or replace those before rendering.
3. **Keyword Handling:** If you have multiple keywords (e.g. “Battlecry,” “Charge,” “Taunt”), confirm each is replaced with an inline `<span>...</span>` and not something that might force a line break.
4. **Test with Short & Long Text:** Try multiple lengths. If you only tested a short text, you might not see the line-break issue show up. If you only tested something quite long, you might see a forced line break.

## Final Checklist

- **Same-Line Keywords**: Confirm “Battlecry:” + subsequent text are a single continuous inline string.  
- **Carved/Engraved Look**: Increase shadow & stroke contrast if text is still invisible.  
- **Container & Position**: Ensure `.card-text-box` or equivalent container is large enough and properly centered.  
- **Responsive**: If your card scales in different views (hand vs. board), test each scenario.

With these adjustments in place, you should achieve:
- Neatly formatted text with no awkward line breaks,  
- A strong yet tasteful “engraved into metal” effect,  
- Clear readability across different backgrounds and card states.

Give those changes a shot, and you’ll have that clean, professional Hearthstone-style text box you’re aiming for! If anything remains off—like line breaks still popping up where they shouldn’t—double-check for hidden characters or forced wrapping in your text processing pipeline.
