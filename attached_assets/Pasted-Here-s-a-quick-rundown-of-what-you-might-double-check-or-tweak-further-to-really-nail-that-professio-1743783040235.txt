Here’s a quick rundown of what you might double-check or tweak further to really nail that professional Hearthstone-style look and legibility:

---

### 1. Double-Check Vertical Spacing
- **Vertical Centering:** Even if you’ve already moved the description down a bit, it may still look slightly “off” if there isn’t enough top padding. Check the computed `line-height` and any top/bottom margins or padding in your `.card-description` container.
- **Overflow Handling:** If the text can grow beyond a certain length, ensure that your container gracefully handles wrapping instead of pushing content into other card elements.

```css
.card-description {
  /* ...existing styles... */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;        /* align text vertically */
  justify-content: center;    /* align text horizontally */
  line-height: 1.2;           /* experiment with different line-heights */
  padding-top: 0.5rem;        /* add extra top padding if needed */
}
```

### 2. Text Outline / Stroke Settings
- **Contrast vs. Background:** If you’re using a metallic or gradient background, a stronger outline or shadow can help. Often `text-shadow` combined with a subtle `-webkit-text-stroke` can give that “carved” effect.
- **Inner Shadow Trick:** If you really want that engraved look, you can experiment with layering multiple shadows—one lighter, one darker—slightly offset. For instance:
  ```css
  text-shadow:
    0 1px 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.3), /* slight highlight top */
    0 -1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);      /* darker engraved bottom */
  ```

### 3. Keyword Highlighting
- **Background Color & Padding:** Since you mentioned using colored backgrounds for different keyword types, consider adding a bit of padding or a rounded border around those highlighted keywords. This ensures the text doesn’t feel cramped.
- **Consistent Keyword Case:** Make sure your keywords are consistently capitalized or uppercase. For example, “Taunt,” “Battlecry,” “Charge,” etc., so they pop on the card.
- **Font Weight:** If you’re mixing bold for the entire description plus bold for keywords, make sure your keywords stand out even more—perhaps with a slightly larger font-size or a contrasting font color.

### 4. Numbers / Damage Values
- **Extra Contrast:** If you’re coloring damage or health values in bright reds or greens, consider adding a small `text-shadow` or a subtle outline to keep them crisp against the background.
- **Slightly Larger Size:** If numbers are crucial (like damage or mana cost references), you may want them a hair bigger for quicker readability. Sometimes a small color-coded circle behind them helps them pop as well.

---

### 5. Responsive & Edge Cases
- **Resizing / Scale:** If your card scales up or down in different places (e.g., hand vs. board vs. full-size preview), ensure the text doesn’t overflow or become too small. Using relative units (`rem` / `em`) tied to the card’s overall size can help.
- **Test with Long Descriptions:** For content-heavy cards (like complicated Legendary battlecries), verifying that the text still looks good at multiple line breaks is essential. Sometimes a property like `overflow-y: auto;` in the description area can help in extreme cases.

## Example Adjusted CSS
Below is a quick snippet to demonstrate a possible approach if you want to combine all these ideas:

```css
.card-description-container {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0.5rem 0.5rem; /* or however you’re positioning it */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;   /* vertical centering */
  align-items: center;       /* horizontal centering */
  text-align: center;
  overflow: hidden;          /* ensure overflow is handled gracefully */
  line-height: 1.2;
  z-index: 10;
}

/* The actual text style (the .card-description might be the <span> or child) */
.card-description {
  font-family: "Belwe", serif; /* or your chosen Hearthstone-style font */
  color: #332211;              /* dark brown for legibility */
  font-size: 1rem;             /* adjust based on scale */
  font-weight: 700;            /* bold for thick readability */
  text-shadow:
    0 1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.35),
    0 -1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  -webkit-text-stroke: 0.7px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* subtle carved effect */
}

/* Keyword-specific styling if you’re wrapping them in a <span> with a .keyword class */
.keyword {
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0 2px;
  padding: 0 3px;
  background-color: rgba(255, 225, 50, 0.3); /* or a color unique to that keyword type */
  border-radius: 3px;
  font-weight: 800;
  color: #5b3400;
  text-shadow: none; /* or apply your own highlight style */
}
```

## Summary
- The changes you made (stronger outlines, better centering, keyword highlights) are definitely on the right track.  
- Double-check the vertical spacing and line-height so the text doesn’t ride too high.  
- Ensure your highlight backgrounds and outlines truly separate the text from the metallic textures in the back.  
- Test with varied text lengths to confirm it stays neat and doesn’t overflow or hide behind the gem or edges.

If you make those minor tweaks, you should have a beautiful, highly legible description area that fits the Hearthstone aesthetic perfectly. Don’t forget to **test** with multiple card examples (including short text, medium text, and very lengthy descriptions) to cover all edge cases.
