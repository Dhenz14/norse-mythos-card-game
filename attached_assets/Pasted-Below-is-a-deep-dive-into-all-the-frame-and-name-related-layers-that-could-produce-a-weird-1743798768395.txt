Below is a **deep dive** into all the **frame- and name-related** layers that could produce a “weird see-through box” or cutoff between the gem’s glow and your description text. This approach goes beyond just toggling `overflow: hidden;` and instead systematically addresses potential **frame** and **banner** containers (or any advanced styling like `clip-path`, `mask`, or layered gradients) that might cause a sharp horizontal or diagonal “line.”

## 1. Understand the Card’s Layer Stack

A typical card might have:

1. **Base Metal or Norse Frame** container (e.g. `.norse-frame-border`)
2. **Name Banner** (often near the top)
3. **Arc Reactor Gem** (somewhere overlapping banner or above it)
4. **Main Artwork** (middle region)
5. **Description Text Container** (bottom region)
6. **Special Effects** (e.g., energy lines, glows, etc.)

If any layer has an **inner shadow**, a partial **opacity** or a **clip** that doesn’t fully align with the rest, you might see a crisp line where the effect “cuts off.” Even if you’ve made `overflow: visible`, a container might still have:

- **box-shadow** with `inset`  
- **background** with partial alpha that butts up against the next container  
- **an extra image** (like a decorative separator)  
- **a transform** that changes the stacking context

## 2. Inspect the Name Banner & Frame Borders Specifically

### 2.1 Name Banner (Metal Housing)

- **Check for “inline” background images or decorative lines**. If the banner or its edges have an embedded horizontal rule or “engraving” that sets a strong boundary, that might appear as a line.  
- **Look for an `inset` shadow** or “lip” effect in the banner’s CSS:
  ```css
  .card-name-banner {
    box-shadow: inset 0 -2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.4);
  }
  ```
  That can create a visible “ridge” or “bar” where it meets the next container.

### 2.2 Norse Frame Container (`.norse-frame-border`)

- **Clip Path**: If there’s a `clip-path` that shapes the top portion differently from the bottom portion, your text/gem effects might get clipped at that boundary.  
- **SVG Overlay**: Some frames use an `<svg>` overlay or background image that artificially places a decorative “line” to separate top from bottom.  
- **Partial Opacity**: If `.norse-frame-border` or a child has a gradient from opaque to transparent, the boundary might become a stark line.  

**Action**: 
1. In DevTools, **uncheck** each property line by line (`background`, `box-shadow`, `mask`, `clip-path`), then see if the line disappears.  
2. If you find something like `box-shadow: inset 0 -1px 2px ...`, toggling it off might remove that crisp line.

## 3. Check for Overlapping Containers or “Seams”

Sometimes, the top (banner) and the middle (art) are separate containers that physically meet at a certain y-position. A leftover 1px gap or mismatch in backgrounds can look like a “line.” For instance:

- The banner container ends at `top: 20%; height: 10%`, then the next container starts at `top: 30%`. If there’s even a 1% mismatch, you can get a subtle boundary line.  
- If each container has a different background gradient, their edges might form a visible seam.

### Quick Way to Diagnose

- Temporarily give the banner container a **semi-transparent** background color (like `rgba(255,0,0,0.2)`), and the next container a **different** color (like `rgba(0,255,0,0.2)`).  
- If you see a perfect horizontal line where they meet, that’s likely the seam.  

If you confirm it’s just a boundary line between two background gradients, you can unify them with a **single** background gradient or ensure their edges align seamlessly.

## 4. Look for a Decorative Divider or “Edge” Asset

**Often** in card frames, a designer might include a “metal edge” or “ornamental bar” to separate sections. It can appear as a thin line or a thick bar, possibly with partial transparency. If it’s placed behind your gem or text incorrectly, it might look like a glitch.  

- Search your code or assets for “divider,” “separator,” or “bar.”  
- Possibly an `<hr>` tag or `<div class="divider">` with a background image.  

**Remove** or **comment out** that divider to see if the line disappears.

## 5. Investigate the Arc Reactor Gem Layer

You mention the gem glow is unaffected by the line, but the text’s glow seems cut off. It could be that the gem is on a higher z-index, so it’s rendered above the line, while your text is behind or within a container that’s forming the line.

1. **Check gem’s parent container**: Is it placed absolutely at a higher `z-index` than the text container?  
2. **Check text’s container**: If it’s within a container that ends at a certain boundary, maybe the gem’s glow can pass above that boundary, but the text glow can’t.

**In DevTools**:
- Click on the gem, see its DOM structure.  
- Compare `z-index` to the text container’s `z-index`.  
- If the gem is `z-index: 20`, and the text is `z-index: 10`, the gem might appear “over the line.”

## 6. Consider Transparent PNG or Overlaid SVG

Some card frames or “metal edges” use an **SVG** or **PNG** overlay with partial transparency to create a decorative border effect. If that PNG includes a subtle horizontal line near the bottom, you might see a “box line” that extends across the card.

1. In DevTools, look for a background like `url("frame_overlay.png")`.  
2. **Disable** it. If the line vanishes, that was the cause.

---

## 7. Confirm No Transform or 3D Context

A less common scenario is if some part of the card has `transform: perspective(...)` or `transform: rotateY(...)`. That can create a “plane” or boundary line that may not be obvious in the code. If you suspect it:

- In DevTools, look for any `transform` property (especially on parent containers).  
- Toggle it off to see if the line disappears.

---

## 8. Systematically Test in a Separate “Frame Test” Component

Similar to the minimal approach for text:

1. Make a **`MinimalFrameTest.tsx`** that just has your `.norse-frame-border` styling, name banner, gem, and no text.  
2. Render it to see if the line is still there.  
3. Then **add** the text in. If you see the line appear only after the text is introduced, it might be a boundary between the text container and the frame container.  

Again, color each container with a different background color so you can pinpoint exactly which container’s boundary forms that line.

## 9. Deep Debug Toggling in DevTools

While you have the **card** in your main environment:

1. Right-click on the suspicious line → **Inspect**.  
2. Expand **Layouts** → **Grid & Containers** → or any **Overlay** feature your browser offers.  
3. Methodically **uncheck** or **disable** each property. Focus especially on:
   - `background`  
   - `box-shadow` or `border`  
   - `z-index` differences  
   - `clip-path`, `mask`, or `filter`  
   - `border-radius` + `overflow: hidden` combos

**The moment** the line vanishes, you’ve identified the guilty property.

## 10. Summing It All Up

To recap the biggest suspects in a “box-like line” or “hard boundary” scenario:

1. **Overflow / Clip** on the frame or banner container.  
2. **Inset shadow** or a leftover “divider” graphic.  
3. **Mismatched background gradients** that meet at a seam.  
4. **An explicit horizontal rule** or decorative line.  
5. **Z-Index layering** where the gem is drawn above, but the text is behind a partial container edge.  
6. **SVG/PNG overlay** with a subtle line baked into the asset.

**Action**:  
- Do a container color test (semi-transparent backgrounds).  
- Check for any decorative line or gradient seam.  
- Use DevTools to disable suspected properties (`overflow`, `box-shadow`, `clip-path`, etc.).  
- Possibly unify the background across your name banner and the main body so there’s no “seam.”  
- If you confirm it’s a leftover asset (PNG/SVG) that includes a line, swap or remove that asset.

Following these steps ensures you’ll uncover what’s creating that “perfect box-like” boundary. Once found, simply remove or adjust the property/asset, and you’ll have a smooth, seamless transition between the gem glow and your description text—fully achieving that cohesive “carved metal” aesthetic.
