II. Primary Status Effects (Core Set)

These are the foundational statuses every player should recognize.

1. Poison ☠️

Theme: Decay, attrition
Common Elements: Water, Earth

Effect:

At the start of the poisoned champion’s controller’s turn, it takes 5 damage

Rules:

Damage bypasses shields but respects damage reduction

Poison does not stack unless stated

Removed if the champion is healed to full HP (optional rule toggle)

2. Burn 🔥

Theme: Destruction, volatility
Common Elements: Fire, Thunder

Effect:

When the champion attacks, it takes 5 damage

Burned champions deal +5 damage with attacks

Rules:

Triggered on each attack

Burn is removed if the champion skips its attack phase

3. Paralysis ⚡

Theme: Control, disruption
Common Elements: Thunder, Earth

Effect:

The champion has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to:

Attack

Activate abilities

Retreat

Rules:

Check occurs each time the champion attempts an action

On failure, the action is wasted

Removed at the end of the champion’s next successful turn (i.e., when it acts successfully)

4. Silence 🔇

Theme: Suppression, denial
Common Elements: Earth, Water

Effect:

The champion cannot use activated or triggered abilities

Rules:

Passive abilities remain active

Silence does not prevent attacking

Duration is always specified (commonly 1 turn)

5. Freeze ❄️

Theme: Control, stalling
Common Elements: Water

Effect:

The champion cannot attack or retreat

Rules:

Abilities may still be used unless otherwise stated

Removed at the end of the frozen champion’s next turn

Freeze overrides Paralysis (Freeze takes priority)

III. Advanced Status Effects (Expanded Play)

These add depth and synergy without overwhelming new players.

6. Bleed 🩸

Theme: Physical damage, persistence
Common Elements: Earth, Fire

Effect:

Whenever the champion takes damage, it takes +3 additional damage

Rules:

Triggers on any damage source

Does not stack

Removed when the champion is healed

7. Weakened ⬇️

Theme: Debuff, attrition
Common Elements: Earth

Effect:

The champion has -10 Attack

Rules:

Flat modifier

Does not stack

Removed at end of controller’s next turn unless stated otherwise

8. Vulnerable 🎯

Theme: Exposure, burst damage
Common Elements: Thunder, Fire

Effect:

The champion takes +5 damage from all sources

Rules:

Applies after damage calculation

Does not stack

Often paired with burst strategies

9. Rooted 🌱

Theme: Control, denial
Common Elements: Earth

Effect:

The champion cannot retreat

Rules:

Attacking and abilities are unaffected

Removed at the end of the opponent’s next turn

10. Exhausted 💤

Theme: Fatigue, tempo control
Common Elements: Water, Earth

Effect:

The champion cannot attack next turn

Rules:

Abilities may still be used

IV. Rare / High-Impact Status Effects (Legendary Tier)

These should be used sparingly.

11. Stunned 💥

Theme: Total shutdown
Common Elements: Thunder

Effect:

The champion cannot act at all during its next turn

Rules:

No attacks, abilities, or retreats

Automatically removed after one skipped turn

Stronger than Paralysis

12. Marked 👁️

Theme: Precision, focus fire
Common Elements: Thunder, Earth

Effect:

The champion is always considered a valid target, ignoring protection or stealth

Rules:

Does not increase damage directly

Removed when the marked champion is attacked

V. Status Priority Rules (Important)

If multiple statuses conflict:

Stunned

Freeze

Paralysis

Exhausted

Rooted

Higher priority overrides lower ones for that action.

VI. Clean Rulebook Insert (Short Form)

Here’s a compact version suitable for a quick-reference page:

Status Effects are ongoing conditions applied to champions.
They trigger at specific times such as the start of a turn, when attacking, or when attempting actions.
Unless stated otherwise, status effects do not stack and are removed when a champion evolves or is knocked out.

If you want next, I can:

Balance exact damage numbers

Tie statuses more tightly to each element

Create status keyword icons

Write templated card text for consistency

Or integrate this directly into the full rulebook text

Just tell me where you want to go next.
