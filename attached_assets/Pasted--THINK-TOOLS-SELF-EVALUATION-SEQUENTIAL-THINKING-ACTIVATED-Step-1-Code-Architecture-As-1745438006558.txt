🔮 THINK TOOLS SELF-EVALUATION 🔮

⚡ SEQUENTIAL THINKING ACTIVATED ⚡
Step 1: Code Architecture Assessment
• Current code uses simple Express endpoints for API access
• ThinkToolsContext provides limited codebase awareness
• ReplitToolsAdapter offers basic integration with Replit tools
• EnhancedResponseFormatter provides standard output formatting

Step 2: Integration Capabilities Analysis
• Limited use of search_filesystem for contextual insights
• Minimal use of str_replace_editor for code modifications
• No integration with execute_sql_tool for database insights
• No integration with web_application_feedback_tool

Step 3: Enhancement Opportunities
• Deeper codebase understanding through code parsing
• AI model integration for advanced recommendations
• Interactive UI components via web interfaces
• Real-time monitoring of code changes and effects

Step 4: Technical Feasibility Assessment
• Most enhancements require moderate to complex development
• Some features need additional infrastructure or external services
• Implementation would need progressive development strategy
• Cost/benefit analysis indicates high value for effort
