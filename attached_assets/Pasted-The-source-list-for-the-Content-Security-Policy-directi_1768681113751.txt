 Cache data may be lost when replacing the dealContext field of a Org object.

This could cause additional (usually avoidable) network requests to fetch data that were otherwise cached.

To address this problem (which is not a bug in Apollo Client), either ensure all objects of type OrgDealContext have an ID or a custom merge function, or define a custom merge function for the Org.dealContext field, so InMemoryCache can safely merge these objects:

  existing: {"__typename":"OrgDealContext","dealType":"default","salesContactEmail":null}
  incoming: {"__typename":"OrgDealContext","dealType":"default"}

For more information about these options, please refer to the documentation:

  * Ensuring entity objects have IDs: https://go.apollo.dev/c/generating-unique-identifiers
  * Defining custom merge functions: https://go.apollo.dev/c/merging-non-normalized-objects
