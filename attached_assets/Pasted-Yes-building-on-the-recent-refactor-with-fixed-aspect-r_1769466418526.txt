Yes, building on the recent refactor with fixed aspect ratio and absolute positioning, let's make these targeted adjustments to reposition elements without any hacks, maintaining full responsiveness and robustness. Ensure all changes align with Hearthstone senior developers' practices: use physical metaphors for layering (e.g., cards feeling tangible behind heroes), clear zoning for elements' 'homes,' and modular components for easy future tweaks. No monkey patches—keep code clean, with CSS variables or React props for positions to avoid the 'fix one, break two' issue.
Here's how to do it step-by-step:

Poker Cards Behind Hero: Move the two poker cards (e.g., Queen and 4) to layer behind the hero (Thor) using z-index (hero higher than cards). Position them absolutely relative to the hero container with percentages (e.g., left: 5%, bottom: -10% of hero height), but clip or offset vertically so only the top 2/3rds are visible—use overflow: hidden on a wrapper or transform: translateY() sparingly if needed for fine-tuning, but prefer natural flow. Ensure they scale with the root container for responsiveness.
Minion Cards Next to Thor: Reposition the three minion cards (blank green ones) immediately to the right of Thor, snug against the hero zone. Use absolute positioning with percentages (e.g., left: 100% of hero width, top: 50% of hero height) within the reference frame. Define a clear zone for minions to prevent overlaps, incorporating subtle animations (e.g., slight tilt on hover) for physicality, as in Hearthstone.
Betting Buttons Under Minions: Place the poker betting buttons (Raise, Call, Fold) directly underneath the minion cards, aligned next to Thor's zone. Position absolutely with percentages (e.g., top: 100% of minion height, left: aligned to minions), ensuring they fit within the scaled viewport without clipping. Use Flexbox internally if needed for button alignment, but keep everything relative to the root for resilience.
Preserve Responsiveness and Visibility: Verify the entire UI remains fully visible—no cutoffs for heroes, stats, mana, or any elements—across all screen sizes. Test with media queries for XL screens and orientation changes. Use Tailwind utilities (e.g., clamp for sizes) to adapt without rigid constraints.
Code Robustness and Modularity: Structure as independent React components (e.g., PokerCards, MinionZone, BettingButtons) with props for positions/sizes. Expose CSS variables (e.g., --card-offset, --minion-spacing) for easy changes without touching logic. Remove any temporary hacks; audit for dead code. Base on Hearthstone's approach: physical layering, modular trays/drawers for zones, and iterative design for upgrades.
Incorporate Pro Best Practices: Reference Hearthstone's immersive UI—tangible elements with homes, scaling without distortion. Compare with open-source clones like EnginKARATAS's: use z-index for depth, percentages for zoning. Add subtle feedback (e.g., button glows) without performance hits.
Testing and Delivery: Provide before/after demos on different devices. Deliver updated code with comments on the architecture.

Implement carefully, and confirm if clarifications needed. This keeps our UI AAA-level and saves future refactoring costs.
