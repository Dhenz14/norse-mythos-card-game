🔮 THINK TOOLS ACTIVATED 🔮

⚡ SEQUENTIAL THINKING ACTIVATED ⚡
Step 1: Analyze Current Protocol Structure
• Review current protocol formats across all documents
• Identify inconsistencies in structure and formatting
• Locate protocol steps that lack numbering
• Evaluate Replit tool integration in current protocols

Step 2: Define Standardized Protocol Template
• Create a consistent template structure for all protocols
• Establish clear step numbering conventions
• Define standard section organization
• Create consistent formatting rules

Step 3: Map Replit-Specific Tools to Protocols
• Identify relevant Replit tools for each protocol
• Match tools with specific protocol steps
• Create tool usage examples for each protocol
• Ensure tool integration is practical and relevant

Step 4: Create Migration Plan
• Prioritize protocols for standardization
• Define sequential update process
• Create verification steps for each protocol update
• Establish consistency checks across documents

Standardized Protocol Template
• Create a consistent header structure with trigger phrase and purpose
• Implement numbered steps (1.1, 1.2, etc.) for all protocol sections
• Add consistent tool reference format for each protocol step
• Include example code blocks with proper formatting
• Add verification steps at key points in each protocol

Protocol Formatting Guidelines
• Use consistent heading levels (H2 for protocol name, H3 for sections)
• Include a quick reference section at the top of each protocol
• Format code examples with syntax highlighting
• Use markdown tables for command references
• Implement consistent indentation for nested steps

Replit-Specific Tool Integration
• Add explicit tool commands at each appropriate step
• Include parameter reference for each tool
• Provide complete example code blocks, not just references
• Ensure tool examples use realistic card game scenarios
• Add error handling guidance for each tool

Key Protocol Improvements
• Convert bullet points to numbered steps throughout all documents
• Add clear section transitions with consistent formatting
• Include verification steps after each significant operation
• Standardize command syntax across all protocols
• Implement consistent note and warning formatting

Implementation Plan
I'll implement a standardized protocol format across all documents, focusing on:


Created PROTOCOL_STANDARD.md
Now I'll update the failedfix protocol to follow our new standardized format:


Edited AGENT_REQUESTED.md

Edited AGENT_REQUESTED.md
Now I'll also update the Card Bug Protocol to follow our new standardized format:


Edited AGENT_REQUESTED.md
Now let's update the Rendering Debug Protocol as well:


Edited AGENT_REQUESTED.md
The agent has reported new progress:
✓ Created PROTOCOL_STANDARD.md with a standardized format for all protocols
✓ Updated AGENT_REQUESTED.md with standardized formats for all troubleshooting protocols:
• Systematic Re-Diagnosis Protocol (failedfix)
• Card Bug Pattern Recognition Protocol (cardbugs)
• Card Rendering Debug Protocol (renderbug)
✓ Added numbered steps (e.g., 1.1, 1.2) to each protocol for easier reference
✓ Added Replit-specific tool commands with complete examples to each step
✓ Added verification steps throughout each protocol
→ What other protocols or documentation would you like me to standardize?
