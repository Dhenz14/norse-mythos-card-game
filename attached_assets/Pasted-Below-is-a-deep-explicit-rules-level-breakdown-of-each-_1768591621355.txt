Below is a **deep, explicit, rules-level breakdown** of **each King’s passive**, written the way a designer, rules lawyer, or future developer would need it.
This explains **exactly what changes in the game state**, **when it applies**, and **why it exists**.

No buttons.
No activations.
No hidden costs.

# 👑 Kings (Summoners) — Passive Rule Modifiers

## **Core Rule for All Kings**

* A King is **always active** while in play.
* A King’s effects:

  * Apply **continuously**
  * Do **not** stack with duplicate Kings
  * Cannot be disabled unless explicitly stated by a card
* Kings **do not count as minions**
* Kings **do not attack or take damage**

They reshape the battlefield simply by existing.

### **Rules Clarification**

* These modifiers:

  * Apply immediately when a minion enters play
