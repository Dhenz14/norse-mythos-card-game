Below is a **final, targeted diagnostic strategy** for tracking down and removing whatever invisible container or property is still clipping your text effects. Rather than editing a dozen places at once, this process isolates **exactly** where the clipping or “box” is coming from. When done systematically, you’ll pinpoint the culprit 100% of the time.

## 1. Use Visual “Colored Containers” to See the Actual Bounds

A quick and foolproof method is to **temporarily color the background** of each container in your card’s hierarchy. That way, you’ll literally see which box is enveloping or clipping the text glow. Here’s how:

1. **Open DevTools** and inspect the element for your card text.  
2. Locate each parent container (up the DOM tree) that might be controlling layout.  
3. For each container, add a temporary rule like:
   ```css
   .card-container-level-1 {
     background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2) !important;
   }
   .card-container-level-2 {
     background: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.2) !important;
   }
   .card-container-level-3 {
     background: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.2) !important;
   }
   ```
   Each container gets a different semi-transparent color.  

4. Refresh the browser and observe **which colored area** is slicing off your text’s glow or forming an unwanted “box.”  

5. Once you see exactly which container’s colored background is matching the bounding box, you’ll know the culprit. Then you can fix that container’s CSS.

## 2. Confirm It’s Not an `overflow: hidden;` or `clip-path`

Even if you’ve set `overflow: visible;` in many places, one leftover container can still have `overflow: hidden`. Also check:

- **`clip-path:`** or **`-webkit-clip-path:`**  
- **`mask:`** or **`mask-image:`**  
- **`clip:`** (less common in modern CSS but still possible)

Again, temporarily **uncheck** them in DevTools. If your glow appears, that was the cause.

---

## 3. Inspect for 3D/Transform Issues

Sometimes a `transform: translateZ(0);` or `perspective: 1000px;` on a parent can create a new stacking context that clips children. If you see any `transform` property in DevTools on a parent container:

- Toggle it off.  
- Check if the text effect is freed.

If that’s the culprit, you might need to move the transform to a different container or handle your 3D transforms differently.

---

## 4. Check “Z-Index Wars” & Parent Dimensions

Occasionally, the text or glow might appear “cut” because it’s behind another element or a parent has insufficient height. For example:

- A sibling container with higher `z-index` covering part of your text.  
- The parent has a fixed `height` or is forcibly squashing the child.  

To verify, look at each parent in DevTools:

- Temporarily add `outline: 2px solid red;` to see how tall or wide it is.  
- If it’s smaller than the text region, that container might be forcing the effect to vanish.

## 5. Final “Minimal Repro” Approach

If all else fails, create a **very basic test** with only:

```jsx
<div style={{
  position: 'relative',
  width: '300px',
  height: '420px',
  overflow: 'visible', // or none
  border: '2px solid magenta',
}}>
  <p style={{
    color: '#FFD700',
    textShadow: '0 0 12px rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.8)',
    // ...
  }}>
    Battlecry: Summon a 2/2 Golem
  </p>
</div>
```

- If the glow shows **perfectly** here (no clipping), then you know your main project’s leftover container is the cause.  
- Start adding other real card elements (banner, gem, etc.) step by step until you see the clipping reappear. That’s precisely where the offending property is introduced.

## 6. Practical Summary

1. **Color Each Parent** (the bulletproof technique to see exactly which bounding box is interfering).  
2. **Toggle Off** suspicious properties (`overflow`, `clip-path`, `mask`, `transform`), one container at a time.  
3. **Check for Z-Index & Dimension Overlaps**.  
4. **Try a Minimal Reproduction** to confirm your text effect works in isolation, then re-introduce your real code piece by piece.

By methodically applying these steps, you’ll discover that **one final** leftover container or style property that’s stubbornly clipping your text. Remove or adjust it, and your “carved into metal” glow will finally be unobstructed, achieving the polished look you’re after.
