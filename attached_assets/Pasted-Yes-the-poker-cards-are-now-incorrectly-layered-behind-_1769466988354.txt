Yes, the poker cards are now incorrectly layered behind the hero (lower z-index), causing only tips to peek out—reversing the physical layering. Senior Hearthstone developers prioritize tangible depth: elements like hand cards layer IN FRONT of heroes with higher z-index, fanning over the bottom edge for immersion without clipping visibility. Fix this precisely while preserving the fixed aspect ratio, absolute positioning, and modularity—no hacks, transforms for positioning, or responsiveness breaks.

Step-by-step correction:

1. **Layer Poker Cards IN FRONT of Hero**: Set z-index of poker cards (e.g., 8 and K) higher than hero portrait (e.g., z-index: 10 for cards, 5 for hero). Position absolutely relative to hero container with percentages (e.g., bottom: 20-30% of hero height, left: 10% for fanning), so cards overlap the BOTTOM edge of hero slightly—full cards visible, top 2/3rds prominently showing, bottom 1/3rd overlapping hero for depth illusion. Mimic Hearthstone hand fanning: natural arc, subtle shadows/offsets for "above" feel.

2. **Maintain Exact Positioning from Desired Layout**: Match attached images—poker cards fanned directly over hero's bottom, fully legible. Use CSS variables (e.g., --poker-offset-y: 25%; --poker-fan-spread: 15%) for easy tweaks without code changes.

3. **Verify Minions and Buttons**: Ensure 3 minion cards stay snug right of hero, betting buttons (Raise, Call, Fold) directly below minions—unchanged, higher z-index if needed for prominence.

4. **Preserve Professional Architecture**: Keep root scale(), absolute % positioning, no overflow:hidden on zones, min-height:auto. Audit z-index stacking contexts—no conflicts causing unintended layering.

5. **Hearthstone-Approved Polish**: Add subtle physicality—card tilt on hover, glow/shadow on overlap for tangibility. Test full visibility on all screens/devices.

6. **Modularity and Testing**: Expose props/CSS vars for poker z-index/offset. Provide before/after demos, code comments on layering.

Implement now, confirm with screenshots. This achieves AAA layering permanently.
