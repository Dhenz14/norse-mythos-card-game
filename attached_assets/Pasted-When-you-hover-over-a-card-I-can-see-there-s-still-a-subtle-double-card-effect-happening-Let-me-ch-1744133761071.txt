When you hover over a card, I can see there's still a subtle double card effect happening. Let me check the NorseFrame.tsx component to see how it's being rendered. There might be additional elements creating shadows or backgrounds that we need to fix:


Opened client/src/game/components/NorseFrame/NorseFrame.tsx
Now I can see the issue! The NorseFrame contains multiple overlay elements that are still being rendered. Let's modify the NorseFrame component to eliminate these extra elements that might be causing the double card appearance:


Edited client/src/game/components/NorseFrame/NorseFrame.tsx
Let's also make sure the frame's CSS has proper styling without excessive shadows or backgrounds:

Let me search for the norse-frame-content class:


Executed grep -n "norse-frame-content" client/src/game/components/NorseFrame/NorseFrame.css
Let's add the norse-frame-content class to the CSS file:


Edited client/src/game/components/NorseFrame/NorseFrame.css
Let's also modify the FixInvisibleBox.css file to prevent any hidden elements causing double card issues:


Opened client/src/game/components/FixInvisibleBox.css
Let's run the web application feedback tool to see if our changes have fixed the issues:

Fix card layering issue causing double card appearance on hover.
I've made several targeted fixes to address both the "double card" appearance and "rigid square glow" issues:

✓ Removed all layered elements from NorseFrame.tsx (border, glow, runes, parallax)
✓ Added proper transparent styling for the norse-frame-content container
✓ Made the Card background completely transparent
✓ Removed all borders and box-shadows that could cause rigid square appearance
✓ Improved the attack indicator by replacing hard edges with blur effects

Please hover over different cards and check if:

The double card appearance is completely gone
The green "can attack" glow looks natural without rigid square edges
