Yes, the previous adjustment placed the poker cards incorrectly below and behind the hero, showing only tips—reversing the intent. To match the desired layout in the second image precisely, let's correct this using Hearthstone-approved practices: physical metaphors where hand cards (poker cards) fan in front of the hero portrait with higher z-index for tangible overlap, snug zoning for minions, centered buttons below hand minions, and optimized vertical spacing to minimize deadspace without hacks.

Implement these targeted fixes step-by-step, building on the fixed aspect ratio, absolute percentage positioning, and modular components. No monkey patches, transforms for core positioning, or code fractures—use CSS variables/props for all adjustments to keep it robust and easy to manage.

1. **Poker Cards Positioning and Layering**: Raise the two poker cards above the hero portrait, positioning them absolutely relative to the hero container with percentages (e.g., top: -30% of hero height, left: 5% for fanning). Set z-index higher for poker cards (e.g., z-index: 10 for cards, 5 for hero) so they layer IN FRONT, with the bottom portions of the cards slightly overlapping the top of the hero for depth—full cards visible, no clipping, mimicking Hearthstone's hand fanning where cards "hover" over the board edge. Use subtle shadows or offsets for physicality; expose --poker-fan-y and --poker-fan-spread variables for tweaks.

2. **Minion Cards Snug Against Hero**: Position the three minion/spell cards in hand (e.g., Völva, Athena's, Midgard) immediately snug to the right of the hero, using absolute percentages (e.g., left: 100% of hero width, top: 0% aligned to hero top). Define a modular MinionHandZone component to prevent overlaps, with flexbox internally for even spacing—ensure they distinguish from active battlefield minions, as in Hearthstone's clear hand vs. board separation.

3. **Betting Buttons Centered Below Minions**: Place the poker betting buttons (Raise, Call, Fold) fully visible and centered directly under the three minion hand cards, aligned to the minion zone. Use absolute positioning with percentages (e.g., top: 100% of minion height, left: 50% - half button width for centering), within a modular BettingButtons component. Ensure no occlusion and high visibility with glows or borders for AAA polish.

4. **Reduce Deadspace Below Hero**: Optimize vertical layout by adjusting the hero zone's bottom position in the reference frame (e.g., bottom: 5-10% of viewport), pulling everything up to minimize empty space between hero/mana bar and screen bottom—use min-height: auto on containers and clamp() for adaptive padding, preserving the 16:9 scale without distortion or cutoffs.

5. **Preserve Responsiveness and Visibility**: Ensure the entire UI scales uniformly on all screens, with no cutoffs or overlaps—test media queries for XL/mobile/orientations. Keep zones clear and elements fully visible.

6. **Code Robustness and Hearthstone Best Practices**: Structure as independent components (e.g., PokerHand, MinionHandZone) with props for positions. Audit for dead code; add comments on architecture. Base on Hearthstone's immersive layering—tangible overlaps, modular trays for hands/zones, iterative design for upgrades. Reference open-source clones like EnginKARATAS for z-index depth and percentage zoning.

7. **Testing and Delivery**: Provide before/after demos matching the second image exactly. Deliver updated code.

Implement carefully, confirming with screenshots. This achieves precise, AAA-quality layout permanently.
