# Artifact & Armor Art Guide — Ragnarok Card Game
## AI Art Generation Reference (78 Artifacts + 30 Armor Pieces)

Each entry includes: **Card ID**, **Hero Owner**, **Flavor Text**, **Visual Art Prompt**, and **Key Iconic Attributes**.

**Art Style Note:** All artifacts should be depicted as **the item itself** — not the hero wielding it. Show the weapon/artifact floating, displayed on a pedestal, or dramatically lit against a thematic background. Think "legendary item reveal" — the card art should make the player feel the weight and history of the artifact. Use a cinematic fantasy illustration style with rich texture and dramatic lighting. The item should fill 70-80% of the frame.

**Flavor Text:**
> "Loki's blade cuts through reality itself, leaving reflections that bite."

An ornate golden lyre-harp with a frame carved from a single piece of ancient yew wood, polished to a warm honey-gold. The strings are made of spun starlight — thin, luminous filaments that shimmer with every color of the aurora.

A massive bronze kettle (cauldron) with a wide mouth, sitting on three dwarven-forged iron legs. The surface is engraved with intricate scenes of the Mead's creation — tiny dwarves Fjalar and Galar, the death of Kvasir, Odin stealing the Mead as an eagle. The liquid inside glows with a deep honey-gold luminescence, and faint runic script floats on its surface like cream on coffee. A ladle made of carved bone rests across the rim.

Its surface is pitted like the lunar surface, grey-white with faint blue luminescence in the craters.

**AI Art Prompt:**
A thin, branch-like weapon — a wand or short staff that looks like a living twig torn from Yggdrasil itself. Despite its frail appearance, it radiates immense dark power. The wood is black as charcoal with veins of smoldering ember-red running through it. At its tip, a single flame burns — not orange but a deep violet-black, a fire that consumes light rather than producing it. Nine tiny iron padlocks dangle from chains along its length, all broken. Thorny vines coil around its base. Background: the roots of Yggdrasil, a massive iron chest with nine broken locks lying open, darkness seeping from within.

> "Her dish is Hunger, her knife is Famine. Her bed is Sickness, her curtains Gleaming Misfortune."

**AI Art Prompt:**
A paired set: a shallow bone-white dish and a long, thin knife displayed together on a cloth of rotting silk. The dish (Hungr/Hunger) is carved from a single giant's skull-bone, its interior eternally empty — a void that seems to pull light into it. The knife (Sultr/Famine) has a blade of black iron so thin it's translucent, with an edge that seems to cut the air itself, leaving faint dark lines. The handle is wrapped in grey sinew. Together they emanate an aura of wasting — nearby surfaces appear to age, crack, and wither. Pale green death-light seeps from both items. Background: Hel's domain — a cold, grey hall with ice-covered walls, a bed of thorns, and curtains of pale sickly light. Color palette: bone white, void black, rotting grey-green, cold ice-blue, withered brown. Haunting dark fantasy item art, deeply unsettling.

**Flavor Text:**
> "Vili gave humanity wit and feeling. His mantle stirs that same spark in all who fight beside him."

**AI Art Prompt:**
A flowing shoulder-mantle/cloak made of what appears to be woven starlight — the fabric shimmers between deep blue and warm gold depending on the angle. Norse runes of intelligence and sensation are embroidered along the hem in silver thread that glows. The mantle's clasp is a golden eye — representing the gift of sight. Where the mantle touches the ground, faint aurora-like light seeps outward, and the stone beneath seems more alive, more detailed. Small sparks of awakening-light float away from the fabric. Background: the creation of Ask and Embla — two wooden figures beginning to come alive, divine light touching them.

**AI Art Prompt:**
A one-handed Viking bearded axe in the historical Mammen style — the broad axe head is inlaid with intricate silver wire depicting Yggdrasil, the World Tree, with its roots and branches filling every surface. The inlay catches light and creates a tracery pattern of breathtaking craftsmanship. The wooden haft is ash wood, polished dark, with leather wrapping at the grip and a bronze butt-cap.

**AI Art Prompt:**
A tall, slender staff of twisted dark wood — iron-wood or rowan — topped with a knobbed head carved into the shape of a distaff (spindle). Silver thread wraps around the staff in a spiral, and at the top, strands of magical energy spin between the prongs of the distaff like thread being spun from raw fate. The staff is decorated with small animal bones, feathers, and leather charms tied at intervals. A faint haze of blue-green seidr magic radiates from the staff. Rune stones float in a loose orbit around the head. Background: a moonlit clearing in a Nordic birch forest, standing stones in a circle.

**AI Art Prompt:**
A weapon that is barely a weapon — a gauntlet/bracer wreathed in living wildfire that cannot be extinguished. The base is charred black iron, cracked and glowing with ember-veins, shaped as a forearm guard. From every crack pours uncontrollable flame — not orange but a deep hungry red-gold that moves with predatory intent. The fire is actively consuming the air around it, creating a visible vacuum effect. Everything near the gauntlet is being eaten — a wooden table beneath it is half-consumed, the stone floor is scorching, even the metal is slowly melting. The flames form brief shapes: a jaw, a tongue, a gaping maw. Background: Utgard-Loki's feast hall, half-consumed by fire. Color palette: charred black, deep red-gold flame, ember orange, ash grey, scorched brown. Destructive fantasy item art, primal and unstoppable.

**Card ID:** 29911 | **Hero:** Magni (Death Knight) | **Attack:** 2

**AI Art Prompt:**
A massive warrior's belt made of linked iron plates and thick leather, wide enough to serve as a corset-belt covering the entire lower torso. Each iron plate is engraved with Thurisaz runes (Thor's rune) that glow with a steady amber-gold power. The buckle is a clenched iron fist. The leather is dark brown, scarred and ancient, reinforced with rivets of meteoric iron. Power radiates from the belt in visible waves of force that distort the air like heat haze. The belt appears to be straining with contained energy, the leather creaking. Background: a frost giant's corpse (Hrungnir) lying fallen, with one massive stone leg visible.

**Flavor Text:**
> "Forged like Gleipnir from impossible things: a cat's footstep, a mountain's roots, a fish's breath."

**AI Art Prompt:**
A set of chains that appear impossibly delicate yet unbreakable — each link is thin as silk ribbon but gleams with a cold blue-white frost that never melts. The chains coil in a loose pile, frost spreading from every link across the surface beneath. Despite their delicacy, they radiate an aura of absolute binding — the air around them is still, frozen. Some links appear to be made of impossible materials: one link is transparent (a fish's breath), one is pure silence (a cat's footstep), one is woven from the roots of mountains. Ice crystals grow from the pile in fractal patterns. Background: a dark cavern beneath Yggdrasil, the bound silhouette of a massive wolf (Fenrir) in the deep distance. Color palette: frost blue-white, impossible-material translucence, deep cavern black, ice-crystal clarity, cold silver. Ethereal dark fantasy item art, beautiful yet imprisoning.

**Flavor Text:**
> "The frost giant king who stole Mjolnir and demanded a goddess as ransom. Theft is in his nature."

**AI Art Prompt:**
A massive, crude crown of blue-grey ice and raw iron — clearly made for a giant's head, far too large for a mortal. Icicles hang from its jagged points like frozen tears. Embedded in the front of the crown is a stolen gemstone — too refined, too beautiful for the crude setting — clearly plundered from Asgard. The ice never melts despite the crown radiating a cold, greedy energy. Claw marks in the metal show where it was torn from its original owner. Frost forms in the air around it, and tiny stolen trinkets (a golden ring, a divine feather, a rune stone) are frozen into the ice band.

A single enormous iron-shod boot, built from countless layers of leather scraps accumulated over millennia — you can see the strata, each layer from a different era, different leather types, different hands. The sole is reinforced with thick iron plate, scarred and dented from immeasurable force. The boot is massive, heavy, and indestructible-looking. Wolf tooth marks are deeply gouged into the iron sole. A faint destiny-light emanates from within, as if the boot itself knows its purpose. Beside it, a single enormous wolf fang lies broken.

**Flavor Text:**
> "So radiant that light shines from him. Every substance in creation swore to spare him — all but one."

**AI Art Prompt:**
Not a weapon but a manifestation — a sphere of pure, warm divine light hovering in the air, so bright it's almost painful to look at. The light is not harsh but gentle, protective, like sunlight through honey. Within the sphere, you can faintly see Baldur's silhouette — beautiful, serene, perfect. Golden shields of light orbit the sphere in slow circles, each one engraved with an oath-rune from a different substance (stone, metal, fire, water, wood).

The surface is stained with ancient blood in the grooves — blood oaths sworn across centuries. Norse runes of binding and oath are deeply stamped into the gold at regular intervals. A drop of fresh blood hovers above the ring, about to fall and seal a new oath. Tiny spectral chains connect outward from the ring to invisible oath-takers.

**AI Art Prompt:**
A jagged crystal shard, about the size of a dagger, made of solidified primordial light. It glows from within with a warm dawn-pink and golden radiance that shifts like a sunrise frozen in crystal. The edges are razor-sharp and emit tiny sparks of creation-energy — miniature galaxies briefly forming and dissolving. The crystal is warm to the touch, even at a distance the viewer can feel its warmth. It floats just above a dark void surface, illuminating everything around it with the first light of existence. Ice (from Niflheim) and fire (from Muspelheim) meet at its edges. Background: Ginnungagap — the primordial void between fire and ice, the exact moment of creation.

A healer's satchel and herbal kit, opened to reveal its contents — bandages woven from golden light, small vials of shimmering silver salve, dried herbs that still glow with life, and a pair of delicate silver scissors. The satchel itself is white doeskin, soft and clean, embroidered with the Algiz rune (protection) in green thread. A warm golden healing-aura radiates from the open satchel, and wherever the light falls, wounds close and pain fades (shown by cracked stone becoming smooth).

**AI Art Prompt:**
A magnificent Nordic longsword floating in midair, fighting by itself with no hand to guide it. The blade is forged from sunlight-infused steel that shifts between warm gold in the fuller and gleaming white at the edges. The sword moves with elegant autonomy — frozen mid-swing, trailing arcs of summer-heat distortion. Wildflowers and wheat stalks grow instantly wherever the blade has passed. The crossguard is shaped like antlers (Frey's sacred animal, the stag). The grip has no hand on it — deliberately empty, symbolizing Frey giving it away.

**AI Art Prompt:**
A shimmering orb of divine breath — a sphere of iridescent vapor that shifts between all colors, contained within a cage of thin golden wire shaped like cupped hands. The orb represents odr (divine inspiration/ecstasy) — the gift of consciousness. Inside the orb, brief flashes show human achievements: a painted cave wall, a forged sword, a written rune, a child's first word. The golden hand-cage is elegant but loose — the gift is given freely. Motes of inspiration-light drift away from the orb, each one a tiny spark that could ignite a new idea. Background: the moment of humanity's creation — two wooden logs (Ask and Embla) beginning to take human form, Hoenir's tall figure gesturing.

**AI Art Prompt:**
An open ash-wood chest (eski) lined with green moss, containing three perfect golden apples. Each apple is literally golden — metallic gold skin that gleams, but clearly organic, with a living leaf still attached. The apples radiate a warm youth-restoring aura — nearby withered vines are blooming, cracked wood is becoming fresh. One apple is cut in half, revealing the inside: a golden crystalline flesh with a single seed of pure light. A fourth apple floats just above the chest, caught in the act of replenishing itself.

A staff made from a living root — still growing, still alive, with fresh green leaves sprouting from its gnarled surface. The wood is deep brown, almost black, with veins of rich dark soil visible in the grain. The root-staff is planted in a small mound of earth that hovers in midair, defying gravity. From the base, smaller roots extend downward and branch outward, anchoring into nothing. Earthworms, beetles, and small fungi thrive on the staff's surface.

**AI Art Prompt:**
A simple wooden bowl, worn smooth by centuries of faithful use, held at a slight tilt. Inside the bowl, a small amount of luminous green-yellow venom glows with toxic light — serpent venom that hisses and steams faintly. A single drop of venom hangs suspended above the bowl, caught mid-drip from a serpent's fang visible at the very top of the frame. The bowl is cracked from the venom's corrosive nature but repaired with golden kintsugi-style mending (gold fills the cracks). Sigyn's fingerprints are worn into the rim from millennia of holding.

**AI Art Prompt:**
An abstract artifact — a floating tongue of golden light shaped like an open mouth mid-speech, with visible sound waves radiating outward as golden rings. Within the mouth-shape, all human language runes are visible: Elder Futhark, Greek, cuneiform, hieroglyphs — every alphabet humanity would ever create, swirling together. Two golden eyes float above the mouth, representing sight. Two golden ear-shapes flank it, representing hearing. Together the three gifts (sight, speech, hearing) form a face-like arrangement of pure divine energy. Sound is made visible as golden ripples in the air. Background: the primordial silence before Ve broke it — a grey-white void with the first sound wave cracking through it like lightning.

A massive dwarven anvil of dark meteorite-iron, its surface covered in thousands of tiny hammer marks from legendary forgings. The anvil glows with residual heat from every divine item ever forged upon it — you can see ghostly afterimages of Mjolnir, Gungnir, and Gleipnir briefly forming on its surface. A master smith's hammer rests against one side, its head worn to a perfect curve by use. Sparks still fly from the anvil despite no work being done — echoes of past creations.

**Flavor Text:**
> "Her arms illuminated all of Jotunheim, sky and sea alike. Even Freyr fell to his knees at the sight."

**AI Art Prompt:**
A pair of elegant arm-guards made of frost-crystal and living light — translucent ice shaped into bracers that emit a breathtaking radiance. The light they produce is cold but beautiful — silver-blue with hints of aurora green and rose. The bracers are carved with frost-giant rune-patterns and edged with tiny diamonds of perpetual ice. The radiance is so intense it illuminates everything within the frame, casting no shadows — only light from all directions. Frost flowers bloom where the light touches surfaces. The bracers float side by side, as if worn by invisible arms spread wide. Background: Jotunheim's landscape illuminated by the bracers' light — frozen mountains, aurora sky, a distant figure (Freyr) kneeling.

> "Gefjon ploughed Zealand from the Swedish mainland with her four ox-sons. The furrows became the great lake Malaren."

**AI Art Prompt:**
A massive iron plowshare — far too large for human hands — with a blade that gleams with sea-salt and earth. The iron is ancient, pitted with age but impossibly sharp. The plowshare is yoked with heavy chains to an invisible team (the four ox-sons). Deep furrows trail behind the plow, and where the blade has cut the earth, water wells up to fill the grooves — forming rivers and lakes in miniature. Clods of turned earth hover in the plow's wake. The blade itself has a map of Zealand etched into it by millennia of use. Background: a dramatic aerial view — the Swedish mainland being torn apart, a massive island (Zealand) being dragged through the sea.

**AI Art Prompt:**
A fishing net made of braided seaweed and hair, weighted with pieces of gold (offerings from sailors). The net floats in dark water, spread wide like a spider's web. Within the net's mesh, ghostly faces of drowned sailors are visible — eyes closed, mouths open, trapped forever. The gold weights gleam despite the deep-water darkness. The net moves on its own, slowly closing like a trap. Bubbles rise from the trapped spirits. The rope handles are barnacle-encrusted and trail into deeper darkness. Phosphorescent deep-sea organisms cling to the weave. Background: the deep ocean floor, Ran's underwater hall visible in the distance — a grand structure made of shipwrecks and coral, lit by gold and ghostly green light.

A conch shell horn (lur) of enormous size, made from a nautilus shell reinforced with gold bands and filled with perpetually swirling seawater that defies gravity. When blown, it calls the tides — shown by miniature waves emerging from the bell of the horn, complete with tiny ships riding them.

**Flavor Text:**
> "The only thing in creation that had not sworn to spare Baldur. Guided by treachery, it found its mark."

**AI Art Prompt:**
A single arrow — seemingly harmless, made from a slender mistletoe branch. The shaft is pale green living wood with tiny white berries still attached, the fletching is made of dove feathers. It looks like a child's craft project, not a weapon. But the arrowhead is a thorn of mistletoe that gleams with a dark, fatal light — a single drop of divine blood on its tip that never dries. The arrow floats in perfect stillness, pointed directly at the viewer. A faint afterimage shows its trajectory — a perfect, guided arc. Everything around the arrow is bathed in warm protective light (Baldur's radiance), but the arrow casts no shadow and is unaffected. Background: a golden hall, the gods laughing and throwing weapons at a luminous figure (Baldur), all bouncing harmlessly off — except this arrow, in flight.

**AI Art Prompt:**
A massive canine fang, ripped from the jaw of a monstrous hound, fashioned into a curved dagger. The fang is bone-white at the root but transitions to dark crimson at the tip — permanently stained with blood that can never be washed away. The weapon is mounted in a grip of black leather and dark iron. Shadows pool unnaturally around the weapon, as if darkness is a liquid drawn to it. The blade seems to phase in and out of visibility — flickering between solid and shadow. A ghostly silhouette of a monstrous hound's head snarls behind the weapon. Red eyes glow from within the shadow. Background: Gnipahellir — a dark cave mouth, chains broken, bloody paw prints leading outward.

**AI Art Prompt:**
A thin silver wire — almost invisible — coiled in a loose spiral on a dark surface. The wire is woven from threads of fate — each strand contains faintly visible text of destinies written and unwritten. Under moonlight, the wire glows with a soft silver-blue luminescence. The wire is impossibly sharp — wherever it crosses itself, it cuts cleanly through. At each end, small carved bone handles shaped like crescent moons. The wire leaves faint trails of silver light in the air when moved. Tiny rune-letters scroll along its length. Background: the Well of Urd at night, the three Norns (shadowed figures) spinning threads by moonlight, Yggdrasil's roots dipping into the water.

The bow is strung with a thread of pure frost that crackles with cold energy. Icicles form along the bow's limbs. Snowflakes orbit the weapon in a lazy spiral. The grip is wrapped in white wolf fur.

The metal is ancient bronze with green patina on the outside but gleaming gold inside. The cauldron overflows with golden ale that sparkles with divine energy — each bubble contains a tiny feast scene. The handles are shaped like sea serpents (Aegir is a sea giant). Steam rises in the shape of celebrating figures — gods feasting. The ale inside shifts with golden light and produces an intoxicating warm glow. Hops and barley spontaneously grow from the cauldron's base. Background: Aegir's undersea hall — a grand mead-hall lit by gleaming gold instead of fire, sea creatures drifting past the windows.

The bow is strung with a gut string that hums with constant tension. Two arrows are depicted: one already in flight (a golden streak disappearing to the right), and one nocked and drawn (a silver-tipped arrow of yew). The nocking point shows wear from thousands of perfect shots. Runes of accuracy are burned into the wood near the grip. An old bone shield (Ullr's skiff) leans against the bow's base.

**Flavor Text:**
> "Vedfolnir sees all from atop Yggdrasil. When the hawk dives, nothing escapes its talons."

**AI Art Prompt:**
A curved talon — a single massive hawk's claw — mounted as a hooked blade on a leather-wrapped handle. The talon is iridescent, shifting between storm-grey and gold as light catches it. The claw is still sharp enough to cut the air itself — visible wind-cuts trail from its tip. Hawk feathers (storm-grey barred with gold) are bound to the handle with leather cord. The weapon trails wind behind it, as if in perpetual dive. A ghostly hawk of enormous size — Vedfolnir — spreads its wings behind the weapon, eyes blazing with all-seeing gold.

**Flavor Text:**
> "Born of Ginnungagap, the yawning void before creation. Its edge cuts through existence itself."

**AI Art Prompt:**
A great scythe whose blade is made of solidified void — not black metal, but actual absence. Where the blade exists, reality isn't — you can see through the blade to a starless void behind it. The edge of the blade shimmers with a faint purple-white outline where existence meets non-existence. The shaft is dark iron wrapped in void-touched leather that seems to absorb light. Anything the blade has touched shows clean cuts where matter simply ceases to exist. Faint echoes of the Big Bang (creation trying to fill the void) spark along the edge. Background: Ginnungagap — the infinite void between the unformed worlds, before fire and ice ever met. Color palette: absolute void-black (the blade), purple-white existence-edge shimmer, dark iron shaft, void-leather that eats light, creation sparks.

The fang is enormous even as a fragment — the dagger is the size of a short sword. It has been crudely sharpened to a wicked edge by grinding against stone, showing the desperation of its maker. The weapon emanates an insatiable hunger — nearby objects seem to lean toward it, drawn in. The pommel is carved into a snarling wolf's head. Saliva-like droplets of acid form on the blade's edge. Faint ghostly chains (remnants of Gleipnir) still cling to the base. Background: the broken chains and massive paw prints of Fenrir's escape, a jaw silhouette against a red sky. Color palette: grey-white bone, wolf-fur dark striations, acid-green droplets, broken chain grey, Ragnarok red sky. Savage fantasy item art, primal hunger incarnate.

**Key Visual Attributes:**
- Fragment of Fenrir's fang (bone-steel material)

## 51. Hyperion's Solar Crown
**Card ID:** 29940 | **Hero:** Hyperion (Mage) | **Attack:** 1

**Flavor Text:**
> "The Titan of heavenly light ordered the first sunrise. His crown still burns with primordial radiance."

**AI Art Prompt:**
A Titan's crown — too large for any mortal head — made of pure solar plasma contained in a ring of adamantine. The crown is a circlet of indestructible silver-white metal from which solar flares erupt continuously upward like a corona. The heat is visible — the air warps and bends around it. Each of the seven points represents a celestial cycle Hyperion ordered: dawn, noon, dusk, moonrise, full moon, eclipse, and solstice. The crown hovers above a scorched marble pedestal, too hot to rest on any surface. Prominence-arcs of plasma bridge between the points. Background: the first sunrise ever — the horizon splitting between the absolute dark of before and the blazing gold of the first day. Color palette: solar plasma gold-white, adamantine silver, heat-warp distortion, scorched marble, primordial sunrise. Titanically powerful fantasy item art, primordial and blinding.

**Key Visual Attributes:**
- Oversized crown of adamantine containing solar plasma

## 52. Vault of Ouranos
**Card ID:** 29941 | **Hero:** Uranus (Mage) | **Attack:** 0

**Flavor Text:**
> "Ouranos IS the sky. Even severed from the earth, the vault of heaven endures."

**AI Art Prompt:**
A dome-shaped artifact — a miniature vault of the sky, about the size of a large shield. The dome's surface IS the actual sky — clouds drift across it, stars appear at night, weather changes in real time. The dome is cracked — a great wound from where Kronos's sickle severed sky from earth — and from the cracks leak starlight and storm. The base ring is forged from the bones of the primordial sky-giant, pearlescent blue-white. Lightning plays across the dome's surface during storms. When damaged, the crack widens and more cosmic energy pours through. Rain falls upward from the dome into the real sky. Background: the moment of severance — Kronos's sickle descending, the sky screaming as it tears from the earth, Giants rising from the blood. Color palette: sky-dome blue shifting through day/night, starlight white through the cracks, pearlescent blue-white base, storm-grey, cosmic purple. Cosmic fantasy item art, the sky itself made artifact.

**Key Visual Attributes:**
- Dome-shaped miniature sky (working day/night cycle)
- Great crack from Kronos's wound
- Starlight and storm leaking from cracks
- Rain falling upward
- Sky-giant bone base ring

**Card ID:** 29942 | **Hero:** Chronos (Mage) | **Attack:** 3

**Flavor Text:**
> "The harpe that severed heaven from earth. Time itself bends around its edge."

**AI Art Prompt:**
A harpe — a curved sickle-sword of adamantine, the indestructible metal. The blade is impossibly sharp, with an inner curve hook designed to castrate and sever. The metal is a dark silver-blue that never tarnishes, never dulls, never breaks. Along the blade, time itself is visible — you can see the blade's past swings as ghostly afterimages, including THE swing that severed Ouranos from Gaia. A clock-like distortion warps around the weapon — time moves slower near the blade. Tiny sparks of chronological energy (past events frozen as amber motes) orbit the sickle. The grip is wrapped in something that was once divine flesh. Background: the throne of the Titans, a massive golden seat, the severed connection between sky and earth visible as a great wound in the world. Color palette: adamantine dark silver-blue, time-distortion amber, ghost-trail white, divine ichor gold, throne gold. Mythically powerful fantasy item art, time-bending and terrible.

**Key Visual Attributes:**
- Curved harpe sickle-sword of dark adamantine
- Ghostly afterimages of past swings
- Time distortion warping around the blade
- Chronological amber motes orbiting
- THE swing that severed sky from earth visible

**IDs:** 29844-29846 | **Theme:** Dark illusion-metal with mirror finishes

**Helm (Mask of Mirrors):** A half-mask of polished black metal that reflects a different face in every surface — never the wearer's. The mask has no eye holes, yet the wearer can see. Snake motifs coil at the temples. When light hits it, illusion-copies shimmer.

**Chest (Shadow Cloak):** A cloak of impossible material that shifts between solid and shadow. The outer surface is dark mirror-black; the inner lining is toxic green. The cloak blurs the wearer's outline. Spell-reduction runes flicker in and out of visibility along the hem.
