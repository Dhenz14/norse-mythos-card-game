## Ragnarok Chess

### Board Layout

The Ragnarok Chess board is a **7×5 grid**:
- Rows 0-1: Player's pieces
- Rows 2-4: Empty (strategic maneuvering space)
- Rows 5-6: Opponent's pieces

### Piece Types & Starting Positions

**Player (Rows 0-1):**
```
Row 0: Knight | Queen | King | Bishop | Rook
Row 1: Pawn  | Pawn  | Pawn | Pawn   | Pawn
```

**Opponent (Rows 5-6) - Mirrored:**
```
Row 5: Pawn  | Pawn  | Pawn | Pawn   | Pawn
Row 6: Rook  | Bishop| King | Queen  | Knight
```

### Piece Stats

| Piece | Base Health | Spell Slots | Has Spells |
|-------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| King | 100 HP | 0 | No |
| Queen | 100 HP | 33 | Yes |
| Rook | 100 HP | 30 | Yes |
| Bishop | 100 HP | 30 | Yes |
| Knight | 100 HP | 30 | Yes |
| Pawn | 100 HP | 0 | No |

### Movement Patterns

| Piece | Movement |
|-------|----------|
| **Queen** | Any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), unlimited distance |
| **King** | Any direction, 1 square only |
| **Rook** | Horizontal and vertical only, unlimited distance |
| **Bishop** | Diagonal only, unlimited distance |
| **Knight** | L-shape (2+1 squares), can jump over pieces |
| **Pawn** | Forward only, 1 square |

### Combat Rules

When a piece moves to a square occupied by an enemy piece:

1. **Pawn vs Any / Any vs King**: Instant kill (Valkyrie Weapon rule)
2. **Major Piece vs Major Piece**: Triggers Poker Combat

### Stamina System

- Each piece has Stamina = Health ÷ 10 (e.g., 100 HP = 10 Stamina)
- Moving a piece grants +1 Stamina to ALL friendly pieces
- Stamina is used for betting in Poker Combat

### Check & Checkmate

- **Check**: King is threatened by enemy piece
- **Checkmate**: King cannot escape check = Game Over
- Kings cannot attack (they can only be captured via instant kill)

### Victory Conditions

- Capture the enemy King (checkmate)
- Eliminate all enemy pieces

### Combat Resolution (Option A Rules)

This game uses a **survival-based poker system** where HP is deducted during betting:

1. **HP is deducted during betting** - When you commit HP to the pot, it's immediately subtracted from your health
2. Both players reveal their best 5-card hand (2 hole cards + 5 community cards)
3. Higher-ranked hand wins
4. **Winner heals** - Recovers only their own committed HP (not the opponent's)
5. **Loser keeps loss** - Does not recover their committed HP
6. If piece HP reaches 0, the piece is eliminated

**Example Showdown:**
```
Player commits 30 HP → Player HP: 100 → 70
AI commits 20 HP → AI HP: 100 → 80

Player wins with Odin's Eye (Flush):
- Player heals 30 HP → Player HP: 70 → 100
- AI keeps loss → AI HP: 80 (lost 20 HP permanently)
```

### Fold Penalty

Folding (Brace) results in:
- **Already committed HP is lost** - No recovery for the folder
- **Winner heals** - Recovers their own committed HP
- **Stamina Penalty**: -1 STA
- Armor absorbs damage first, then remaining damage applies to HP

**Example Fold:**
```
Player commits 20 HP, then folds:
- Player HP: 100 → 80 (20 HP lost permanently)
- Opponent recovers their committed HP
- Player loses 1 STA
```
