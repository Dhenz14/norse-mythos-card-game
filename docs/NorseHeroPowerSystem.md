# PART 1: KINGS (SUMMONERS) - PASSIVE RULE MODIFIERS

## Core Rules for All Kings

1. A King is **always active** while in play
2. King effects:
   - Apply **continuously** to all friendly minions
   - Do **NOT** stack with duplicate Kings
   - Cannot be disabled unless explicitly stated by a card
3. Kings **do not count as minions**
4. Kings **do not attack or take damage**
5. Kings reshape the battlefield simply by existing

---

## King Roster (9 Primordial Beings)

### 1. Ymir — The Primordial Frost Giant

**Role:** Tempo Pressure / Attack Skew  
**Element:** Water (Ice)

#### Passive Effects
| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Frost Giant's Might** | All friendly minions gain **+2 Attack** |
| **Chilling Presence** | All enemy minions suffer **–1 Attack** |

#### Rules Clarification
- These modifiers:
  - Apply immediately when a minion enters play
  - Update dynamically if control of a minion changes
- If a minion's Attack would drop below **0**, it is treated as **0**
- This does **not** permanently modify base stats (buffs are aura-based)

#### Gameplay Impact
- Early trades heavily favor the Ymir player
- Small minions become lethal threats
- Enemy boards struggle to stabilize

#### Design Intent
> Ymir **forces combat**. He compresses the game timeline and punishes slow setups.
> **If you hesitate, Ymir wins.**

---

### 2. Buri — The First God

**Role:** Attrition / Scaling Defense  
**Element:** Light

#### Passive Effects
| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Primordial Shield** | All friendly minions gain **+1 Armor** |
| **Eternal Growth** | At the **start of your turn**, all friendly minions gain **+1 Health** |

#### Rules Clarification
- Armor reduces incoming damage before Health is affected
- Start-of-turn Health gain:
  - Can exceed original maximum Health
  - Is **permanent** (not temporary buff)
- Triggers before other start-of-turn effects (priority: King passives first)

#### Gameplay Impact
- Boards grow harder to clear over time
- Chip damage becomes ineffective
- Favors long, grinding games

#### Design Intent
> Buri rewards **patience and survival**.
> **You don't win quickly. You win by outlasting everything.**

---

### 3. Surtr — The Fire Giant

**Role:** Pressure / Board Erosion  
**Element:** Fire

#### Passive Effects
| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Flame Touched** | All friendly minions gain **+1 Attack** |
| **Muspelheim's Burn** | At the **end of your turn**, deal **1 damage to all enemy minions** |

#### Rules Clarification
- End-of-turn damage:
  - Occurs after all attacks and abilities resolve
  - Can destroy minions (triggers deathrattles)
  - Does **not** damage the enemy King or Hero
- Damage is applied simultaneously to all enemy minions

#### Gameplay Impact
- Enemy boards slowly melt away
- Low-health units cannot remain idle
- Forces opponents into suboptimal trades

#### Design Intent
> Surtr makes **doing nothing lethal**.
> **If you don't act, the fire will.**

---

### 4. Borr — The Primordial Father

**Role:** Death Value / Board Persistence  
**Element:** Grass (Earth)

#### Passive Effects
| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Father's Blessing** | All friendly minions gain **+1 Health** |
| **Echo of Life** | When a friendly minion dies, summon a **1/1 Echo of Borr with Taunt** in its place |

#### Rules Clarification
- The Echo:
  - Occupies the same board position
  - Is a **new minion** (can be buffed, targeted, killed)
  - Has Summoning Sickness (cannot attack that turn)
  - Does NOT trigger when tokens die (unless explicitly stated)
- Echo summons happen after deathrattle effects resolve

#### Gameplay Impact
- Removing minions never fully clears the board
- Trades become awkward and inefficient for opponent
- Excellent counter against burst damage and AoE

#### Design Intent
> Borr **denies clean victories**.
> **Death is not an ending — it's a delay.**

---

### 5. Yggdrasil — The World Tree

**Role:** Growth Engine / Scaling Power  
**Element:** Grass (Nature)

#### Passive Effects
| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Life Spring** | At the **start of your turn**, restore **2 Health** to all friendly minions |
| **Roots of Power** | Whenever a friendly minion is healed, it gains **+1 Attack permanently** |

#### Rules Clarification
- Healing includes:
  - This passive's healing
  - Any other heal effects (spells, hero powers, abilities)
- **Overhealing still counts** as "healed" (even if at full HP)
- Attack gain stacks without limit
- Multiple heals in one turn = multiple Attack gains

#### Gameplay Impact
- Minions scale every single turn
- Defensive boards become offensive threats
- Opponents must disrupt early or lose to snowball

#### Design Intent
> Yggdrasil converts **survival into dominance**.
> **Growth is inevitable if left unchecked.**

---

### 6. Auðumbla — The Primordial Cow

**Role:** Sustain / Board Stability  
**Element:** Water (Life)

#### Passive Effects
| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Nourishing Presence** | All friendly minions gain **+1 Health** |
| **Gift of Life** | Whenever you play a minion, restore **1 Health** to all friendly minions |

#### Rules Clarification
- Healing triggers immediately after a minion enters play
- Playing multiple minions in one turn = multiple heals
- Does NOT heal the King or Hero (only minions)
- Synergizes with Yggdrasil's heal-to-attack conversion

#### Gameplay Impact
- Swarm strategies thrive under Auðumbla
- Boards recover rapidly after trades
- Excellent counter against chip damage and poke strategies

#### Design Intent
> Auðumbla rewards **presence and numbers**.
> **Life feeds life.**

---

### 7. Blainn — The Dark One

**Role:** Control / Disruption  
**Element:** Dark (Shadow)

#### Passive Effects
| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Shadow's Embrace** | All friendly minions gain **+1 Health** |
| **Touch of Frost** | At the **start of your turn**, Freeze a **random enemy minion** |

#### Rules Clarification
- Frozen minions:
  - Cannot attack
  - Cannot activate attack-based abilities
  - Remain frozen until their controller's next turn ends
- Random selection:
  - Ignores Stealth (can freeze stealthed minions)
  - If only one enemy minion exists, it is always chosen

#### Gameplay Impact
- Key enemy threats are delayed
- Tempo swings without dealing damage
- Excellent counter against single-threat/big minion decks

#### Design Intent
> Blainn **wins by denial**, not force.
> **You don't lose your army — you lose your momentum.**

---

### 8. Brimir — The Bloody Moisture

**Role:** Aggression Through Death  
**Element:** Fire (Blood)

#### Passive Effects
| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Blood Rage** | All friendly minions gain **+1 Attack** |
| **Death's Echo** | When a friendly minion dies, deal **1 damage to all enemy minions** |

#### Rules Clarification
- Triggers per death:
  - Multiple minions dying = multiple damage instances
  - Can chain-kill enemy minions (which may trigger their deathrattles)
- Damage resolves even if the board becomes empty
- Does NOT damage enemy King or Hero

#### Gameplay Impact
- Sacrificial play becomes optimal strategy
- AoE damage builds up naturally through trades
- Opponents are punished for killing your units

#### Design Intent
> Brimir turns **loss into pressure**.
> **Blood spills both ways.**

---

### 9. Ginnungagap — Primordial Chaos

**Role:** Chaos / Variance / Adaptation  
**Element:** Dark (Void)

#### Passive Effects
| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Void Spawn** | At the **end of your turn**, summon a **1/1 Void Spawn** with a **random keyword** |

#### Rules Clarification
- Keywords are chosen from the standard keyword pool:
  - Taunt, Divine Shield, Stealth, Rush, Charge, Poisonous, Lifesteal, Windfury
- Excludes King-exclusive effects
- Void Spawns:
  - Count as friendly minions (affected by other King passives)
  - Have Summoning Sickness
  - Can stack keywords if multiple spawns exist

#### Gameplay Impact
- Board state constantly mutates and evolves
- Unpredictable threats emerge every turn
- High variance, high creativity ceiling

#### Design Intent
> Ginnungagap rewards **embracing uncertainty**.
> **Creation is chaos made solid.**

---

## King Balance Summary

| King | Core Axis | How It Wins | Counter Strategy |
|------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Ymir** | Tempo | Faster, deadlier trades | Wide boards, healing |
| **Buri** | Attrition | Outlasting removal | Burst damage, silence |
| **Surtr** | Pressure | Passive board damage | High-health minions |
| **Borr** | Persistence | Death doesn't clear board | Transform effects, exile |
| **Yggdrasil** | Scaling | Healing becomes attack | Early aggression |
| **Auðumbla** | Sustain | Constant recovery | Burst, prevent healing |
| **Blainn** | Control | Delayed threats | Wide boards, Rush |
| **Brimir** | Aggro | Death fuels damage | High-health minions |

## Weapon Upgrade System

### Overview
Each hero has a unique 5-mana Weapon Spell that:
1. Provides an immediate powerful effect
2. Permanently upgrades their hero power for the rest of the game

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface WeaponUpgradeCard {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  type: 'weapon_upgrade';
  manaCost: 5; // Always 5 mana
  heroId: string; // Links to specific hero
  immediateEffect: SpellEffect;
  upgradesHeroPowerTo: string; // Name of upgraded power
  description: string;
  flavorText?: string;
}
```

### Upgrade Execution Flow
1. Player plays weapon card (must have 5 mana)
2. Deduct 5 mana from player
3. Execute `immediateEffect`
4. Replace `player.heroPower` with upgraded version
5. Set `heroPower.isUpgraded = true`
6. Weapon card is consumed (goes to graveyard)

  | 'start_of_turn'       // At start of hero's turn
  | 'always';             // Continuous aura effect
```
