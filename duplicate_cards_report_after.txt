# Duplicate Cards Report (After Cleanup)

Date: April 01, 2025
Status: ✅ No Duplicates Found

## Summary of Cleanup

Original Duplicate Count: ~229 cards with duplicates
Current Duplicate Count: 0 cards with duplicates

## Cleanup Process
1. Created a comprehensive set of scripts to identify and remove duplicate cards
2. Implemented a file-priority based deduplication system
   - Preferred specialized files (iconicLegendaryCards.ts, legendaryCards.ts, etc.)
   - Removed duplicates from lower-priority files (cards.ts)
3. Fixed specialized duplicates using targeted scripts
4. Added documentation for duplicate resolution strategies

## Cleanup Scripts
- fix_all_duplicates.cjs: Main script for deduplication
- clear_duplicates_from_cards.cjs: Specialized script for cards.ts
- fix_remaining_duplicates.cjs: Final script to clean up edge cases

## Benefits of Deduplication
- Reduced codebase size and complexity
- Eliminated potential conflicts in card behavior
- Improved maintainability of the card database
- Ensured cards with specialized mechanics remain in their proper files
- Maintained integrity of themed collections (Old Gods, Colossal, Highlander, etc.)
- Preserved the most detailed implementation of each card

## Verification
A final scan with find_duplicates.js confirms zero duplicates remain in the codebase.
