/**
 * signedMove.ts - Game move records for Merkle transcript proof
 *
 * During gameplay, every action (playCard, attack, endTurn, useHeroPower)
 * is recorded as a GameMove. At game end the TranscriptBuilder hashes all
 * moves into a Merkle tree whose root is embedded in the match_result.
 *
 * Individual moves are NOT signed via Keychain (that would require a popup
 * per move). Instead the Merkle root is signed once at game end as part of
 * the dual-signature match result flow.
